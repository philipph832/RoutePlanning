# RoutePlanning

This code is dedicated to perform several steps on a gpx-file
1) perform overpass-querries to identify certain points (mostly amenities along a route)
2) safe these as Waypoints in a new file
3) plot the track and waypoints on a map
4) integrate the new waypoints as Course Points into the track
5) correctly calculate distances between the points and time
6) write evrything in a garmin fit-file to be used for navigation on any garmin device
